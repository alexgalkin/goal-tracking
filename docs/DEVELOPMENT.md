# Development Notes

## Services used

1. `Github Copilot` and `VS Code` were used to generate `95%+` of the codebase (at least by `January 19, 2025`)
2. `Arvin` android mobile application was used to generate logo and few images.
3. [Favicon generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) service was used to generate a set of `favicons` for the web app.
4. `Firebase` services were used to simplify development of `authentication`, `storage` and `hosting` of the web app itself.
